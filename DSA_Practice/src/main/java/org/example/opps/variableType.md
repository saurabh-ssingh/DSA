**Instance variables** (also known as fields) in a class are stored in the heap memory, and they remain in memory for the lifetime of the object. If you define a variable as an instance variable, it is allocated memory when the object is created and deallocated only when the object is garbage collected.

On the other hand, **local variables** are stored on the stack and only exist for the duration of the method call. They are automatically deallocated when the method exits.

### Memory Implications

#### Instance Variables:

- Allocated memory remains as long as the object exists.
- If an instance variable is not needed beyond the scope of a single method, keeping it as an instance variable leads to unnecessary use of memory.

#### Local Variables:

- Memory is allocated when the method is invoked and released when the method exits.
- Using local variables reduces the memory footprint of the object since the memory for these variables is only temporarily allocated during method execution.

### In Your Example:

In the `OpenApiConfig` class, the variables `SECURITY_SCHEME_NAME`, `SCHEME`, and `BEARER_FORMAT` are only used within the `customOpenAPI()` method. Defining them as instance variables means they occupy memory as long as the `OpenApiConfig` object exists, even though they are only needed during the execution of `customOpenAPI()`.

By converting them to local variables:

- The memory for these variables is only allocated during the method call and is released immediately after the method finishes executing.
- This is more efficient because it minimizes the overall memory footprint of the `OpenApiConfig` object, particularly when many such objects could exist simultaneously in an application.

### Example Scenario

Imagine we have a class that generates a configuration string for a specific task. The configuration includes several parameters that are only used within a method.

#### Using Instance Variables:

```java
public class ConfigGenerator {
    // Instance variables
    private String param1 = "value1";
    private String param2 = "value2";
    private String param3 = "value3";

    public String generateConfig() {
        return param1 + "-" + param2 + "-" + param3;
    }
}
```
**In this example:**

- `param1`, `param2`, and `param3` are instance variables.
- Memory is allocated for these variables as long as the `ConfigGenerator` object exists, even though they are only needed during the `generateConfig()` method execution.
- If `ConfigGenerator` is instantiated multiple times, memory is allocated for these instance variables in each object.

### Using Local Variables:

```java
public class ConfigGenerator {

    public String generateConfig() {
        // Local variables
        String param1 = "value1";
        String param2 = "value2";
        String param3 = "value3";
        
        return param1 + "-" + param2 + "-" + param3;
    }
}

```

**In this revised example:**

- `param1`, `param2`, and `param3` are now local variables within the `generateConfig()` method.
- Memory is allocated for these variables only when the `generateConfig()` method is called and released immediately after the method finishes.
- This reduces the overall memory usage of the `ConfigGenerator` object because these variables don't persist beyond the method execution.

### Memory Usage Comparison:

- **Instance Variables:** If `ConfigGenerator` objects are created but `generateConfig()` is rarely called, the memory allocated for `param1`, `param2`, and `param3` remains unused but still occupies space.
- **Local Variables:** The memory is only allocated when needed, making the application more memory efficient, especially in environments where many instances of `ConfigGenerator` are created.

This example shows why it’s more efficient to use local variables when the data doesn't need to persist beyond a method’s execution.
