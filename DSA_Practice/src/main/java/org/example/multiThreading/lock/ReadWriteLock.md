# ReadWriteLock in Java

A `ReadWriteLock` in Java is a type of lock that allows multiple threads to read a resource concurrently while still providing exclusive access to one thread for writing. It achieves this by maintaining two separate locks:

1. **Read Lock:** Multiple threads can hold this lock simultaneously as long as no thread holds the write lock.
2. **Write Lock:** Only one thread can hold this lock at a time, and no other thread can hold either the read or write lock while this lock is held.

This approach is useful in scenarios where reads happen more frequently than writes, allowing for better concurrency and performance compared to a simple exclusive lock.

## Example Scenario

Consider a shared data structure, like a list, that is frequently read but occasionally modified. We want to allow multiple threads to read the list concurrently but ensure that when one thread is modifying the list, no other thread can read or write.

## Java Example Using `ReadWriteLock`

Hereâ€™s a simple example using `ReadWriteLock` in Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ReadWriteLockExample {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

    // Method to add an element to the list (write operation)
    public void add(String element) {
        lock.writeLock().lock(); // Acquiring the write lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " writing: " + element);
            list.add(element);
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock(); // Releasing the write lock
        }
    }

    // Method to read an element from the list (read operation)
    public String get(int index) {
        lock.readLock().lock(); // Acquiring the read lock
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reading: " + index);
            return list.get(index);
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock(); // Releasing the read lock
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReadWriteLockExample example = new ReadWriteLockExample();

        // Writer thread
        Thread writer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.add("Element " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate write time
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        // Reader threads
        Thread reader1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.get(i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate read time
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        Thread reader2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                example.get(i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate read time
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });

        writer.start();
        reader1.start();
        reader2.start();
    }
}
```
## Explanation

- **Write Operation (`add` method):** When a thread calls the `add` method, it acquires the write lock, preventing any other thread from reading or writing until it completes.

- **Read Operation (`get` method):** When a thread calls the `get` method, it acquires the read lock, allowing other threads to read simultaneously but blocking any write operations.
